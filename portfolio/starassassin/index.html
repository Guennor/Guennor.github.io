  <p><b>Star Assassin</b> is a shoot'em up game that I have been working on as a level designer as a part of a larger team of
  skilled professionals who are also really cool people. As a level designer, I create the level design documents for each level, detailing
  boundary placement, enemy presence, puzzles, challenges, etc. Sometimes I also try to help creating the scenes for the levels in Unity, too.
  There's a demo you can find in the <a href="http://www.sweetgaming.co.uk/" target="_blank">official website!</a></p>

    <h6>This simple website was made by me (with some help from my buddy Marcos!). I'd much rather have a simple website made by myself than a fancy one that I paid someone to make for me. Gotta have dat html/css knowledge!</h6>
