  <h5>Greetings, stranger!</h5> <p>Welcome to my website. </p>
  <p>I'm Igor, and I like creating things. Specially video games.<br>

    Even though I have knowledge on various game development-related areas (2D and 3D art, programming, sound editing, etc), I consider myself to be a Game Designer (I mean, I even have a Game Design degree).
    I like to say that I know just enough of the other areas so I can make prototypes or even simple games by myself, without having to ask for an artist's or a programmer's help.

    <h6>This simple website was made by me (with some help from my buddy Marcos!). I'd much rather have a simple website made by myself than a fancy one that I paid someone to do.</h6>
    <h6>The way I see it, I didn't spend a cent, got some HTMLl/CSS knowledge, and got a website of my own!</h6>
