  <h5>Up, Up!</h5>

  <p>My role in this project: <b>EVERYTHING!</b><p>
  <img src="../../images/portfolio/upup_icon.png" alt="" align="middle">
  <p><i><b>tl;dr:</b> Another sort of "runner" game where you swipe to create wind and get your little creature as high as
  possible, while avoiding obstacles. The simple idea was devised by me during a game jam.</i></p>
  <p>The concept behind <b>Up, Up!</b> was created during a ludum dare game jam. The theme was <a href="http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-36/" target="_blank">Ancient Technology</a>, and
  I quickly came up with the idea of making a game with physics-based movement, where you created wind to go as high
  up as possible. The game was unoriginally called "WindPowered!" and I managed to make it during the 72 hours available
  to me. You can play it <a href ="../../files/WindPoweredWebGL/index.html" target="_blank">here</a>(might take a while
  to load, sit tight!)</p>
  <p>It was the only game jam competition that I managed to finish a
      presentable game, but unfortunately, it was also the only one where they didn't hold votings for different categories
      due to a problem they were having. The <a href="http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-36/?action=preview&uid=28702">
      really nice comments</a> that people made were awesome to read, though.</p>

    <h6>A gif showing the original prototype with placeholder art assets and another one with the finished game.</h6>

    <p>The most important part of this is that I was able to make a game with some fun potential, from scratch, in 3
    days. I wondered if I could make an improved commercial version in maybe a month - I had just left my previous job,
    and could use some ad revenue money. I had some savings that I could use to last for a month anyway.
    That's when I came up with Up, Up!</p>
<h2>The game</h2>
<p>The premise of the game is the same. Swipe to create wind. Move up and avoid obstacles, find challenges along the way.
Instead of using the 2D graphics of the game jam, I chose to make it hard-edge 3D lowpoly, with no textures, just painted polygons.</p>
 <img src="../../images/portfolio/upup_cover.gif" alt="" align="middle">
<h6>I always liked this style and this was the first time I tried to use it.</h6>
<p>I thought of some small features to make the gameplay less bland. One feature was already present in WindPowered!,
so I took it and improved it - Wind gates, as I called them, were literal gates blocking upward movement, and to open
these gates you have to swipe in the direction where the arrows are poiting, in the order displayed onscreen.
There were other types of gates planned, like the windy crank gate, which would spin if you created wind, so you needed
to keep making wind to spin it so it would slowly open up.</p>
<img src="../../images/portfolio/upup_gameplay.gif" alt="" align="middle">
<h6>Wind Gates could have from 3 to 5 directions you needed to swipe in order. They could either be harmless or have spikes.</h6>
<p>Another nice little system that was starting to take shape was the weather and random event system. In the latest version
there was just lightning, thought I made it easy-ish to add new events. After a certain height was passed, there was a tiny chance
on each swipe that would cause lightning and a storm.</p>
<img src="../../images/portfolio/upup_thunder.gif" alt="" align="middle">
<h6>In the current stage of the game, thunderstorms don't do anything other than obscuring sight a bit, but I had cooler
plans for it, like winds that move you a bit and charged clouds that kill you if you go under them.</h6>

<p>Another element I added to the game is a simple crafting system. You gathered resources during the game and could use
those to craft other resources and items. You start with broken crafting stations that you have to repair to be able to
use, and as you repair them you are given access to new items you can make. You can also repair the mines and use pickaxes
to get ores, by actively reaching certain distances, depending on the ore. For instance, if a certain ore required 1000
meters, you'd get it after playing once and reaching 400 meters and then another time and reaching 600 meters. Rare ores
would require a lot of meters to be gathered.

The ultimate items were shields that broke after a few impacts, to help you reach new heights. But I had a few ideas for
other items that could make the game more interesting, I just didn't want to add them to the GDD or else i'd take too long
to finish the game. I had only 1 month, after all.</p>

<h6>To the left, the crafting stations being repaired and used. I crafted a simple wooden pickaxe to be able to use the mines
    (most UI images are placeholder!). To the right, some documentation I wrote in order not to forget the many items of the system.</h6>

<p>During the development of the game, I was fortunate enough to be able to afford to go to Unite 2016 with a couple game
developer buddies of mine. There I watched a presentation about using Unity Ads, exactly what I needed in my game.
The presentation was given by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/laurenckoester/" target="_blank">Lauren Koester</a>, then business development manager at Unity Ads. It was not so much about the
technical part of implementing ads in a game, but more about engaging ways to do it.
After her presentation I was humbled to be able to meet her and show her Up, Up! and get some guidance on ways to
monetize my game in an honest, but engaging way. She gave me her card and a really cool sticker. :D

<h6>Some random picture I took of the event. I know it's just a table, but trust me when I say this was the best picture of the event that I could find. The
rest were pictures of the snack tables they had there.</h6>

<p>After the event I came home with my notes and started to create the variables and classes that would make the monetization
of my game possible. The first thing that I tried to make was the "watch an ad to revive" system. The concept was simple enough,
but I had trouble when it came to implementing daily ad limits.</p>
<img src="../../images/portfolio/upup_revive.gif" alt="" align="middle">
<h6>No matter how hard I tried to make it work or how many tutorials I watched, I could never make this "ad" button work. I remember the frustration to this day!</h6>
<p>It was almost the end of the month and my funds ran out. It turned out that one month was not enough to finish the game,
    even though I managed to get a lot done in such little time. I had to move on to doing freelance stuff and had to shelf
    the project. Much later I tried to go back to the project again, while still working on other projects, but failed to
    continue working on it properly - it was very hard to understand the code that I once wrote, and I also had some trouble
    authenticating the project with google play again, so I decided that until I have more time to work with it, i'll just
leave it as it is.</p>
