  <h5>Astria: The Space Gurl</h5>
  <p>Status: <i>Unfinished ):</i></p>

  <p><b>Astria: The Space Gurl</b> was the first game that I made after finishing college. It holds a special place in my heart, because
  it was my first actual game that I made 100% by myself. It was such a good feeling to make it, I had just finished college, where during
  every semester, the games were limited by themes defined by a board of teachers, and even the simplest mechanic had to be changed based
  on other people's opinions. I always knew that limitations like that are prominent in the game development industry, but that very
  knowledge made the development of Astria so much more special to me, because the only limitations were my abilities.</p>

  <p>I created the game out of a need I felt when browsing Google Play Store back then: there were no good survival games.
  I would search for survival-game-related terms and would be presented with a seemingly endless list of effortless, annoying,
  minecraft clones, games that to me are a disease that is slowly killing the mobile market.
  </p>

  <p>I remember having the idea of the game during a lazy afternoon, when I simply started scribbling and doodling the main
features of the game. Also, I really wanted to use what I had learned a year before with my research paper about one handed
mobile game usability.</p>

<h2>The game</h2>
<p>The game takes place in an asteroid in space. You control a space gurl called Astria, and the asteroid you inhabit contains
machines, farms and pumps that help with your survival. You get money by crushing asteroids that you collect in space, and with
money you can upgrade your machines and buy new ones, like fuel pumps and rocket shops to buy spaceships and go to deep space.</p>

<p> I always thought that digital dual-sticks felt terrible in mobile games
(though I don't think this topic was present in my research), because you can't feel both input methods due to
a lack of haptic feedback in most phones, so coordinating two touch joysticks at the same time without feeling them can be
tricky. But a single digital joystick seemed like it could work. And so I implemented it, but what about selecting things?
I didn't want to add a button next to the joystick, so I thought of something I had never seen before, a digital joystick with
a contextual button. It worked simply by creating a button in the place of the "handle" of the joystick, whenever an action was
needed. You could simply release the joystick and press the button. Of course, the whole game had to be designed around this concept.
