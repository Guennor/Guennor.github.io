  <h5>Star Assassin</h5>

  <p>My role in this project: <b>Level Designer</b><p>
  <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XZACDVJ1hpw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

  <p><b>Star Assassin</b> is a shoot'em up game that I have been working on as a level designer as a part of a larger team of
  skilled professionals who are also really cool people. As a level designer, I create the level design documents for each level, detailing
  boundary placement, enemy presence, puzzles, challenges, etc. Sometimes I also try to help creating the scenes for the levels in Unity, too.
  There's a demo you can find in the <a href="http://www.sweetgaming.co.uk/" target="_blank">official website!</a></p>
