  <h5>Ravina</h5>

  <p><b>My role in this project:</b> The project was almost entirely designed and implemented by me, except for a few things
      like the audio and save system.<p>

  <p><i><b>tl;dr:</b> A sort of "runner" game where you control an explorer diving into a ravine with a rope attached to
  himself. You can find more rope during your trips, to extend the maximum range you can reach on the following trips,
  and find resources to aid in your adventures.</i></p>


  <p>Ravina<b></b> is the game that I made for my final university assignment. Technically we had a year to make the game,
  but the first semester was almost entirely dedicated to the research and the second semester was dedicated to the game. The research was
about safe and comfortable one-handed usability for gaming in mobile devices, and the game was built to try to prove the
findings of the research. So yeah, we had a single semester to make it... seems like a lot of time, but not to my skills I guess!
The group had a disagreement on whether to start the game during our midterm break which divided the "research semester"
with the "game semester" so I had to go ahead and start production by myself, which is the reason the game was made almost
entirely by me - when the midterm break was over, the development was so advanced that they couldn't even understand my code enough
to be able to help implementing anything.
The part of the code with the save system was implemented by another team member, and the audio was acquired
and edited by another team member, but the rest of the game was made by me. The group helped with other very important tasks,
though, like polishing the GDD/research paper or creating the marketing document and doing other scholarly things I couldn't
focus on.</p>

<h2>The game</h2>

<img src="../../images/portfolio/rav_intro.gif" alt="" align="middle">

<p>You control an adventurous researcher that sets out to explore a mysterious ravine that opened up somewhere. Equipped with
some rope and mining equipment, you jump down to explore the narrow gorge. You can find lost pieces of rope from previous
adventurers, which allow you to reach further down on your following attempts.</p>
<img src="../../images/portfolio/rav_gp1.gif" alt="" align="middle">
<h6>Sorry for the quality! I have no good mobile device recording software.</h6>

<p>There are 4 lanes you can stay on. This simplifies the gameplay a bit but keep things more fair, and also helps align
the gameplay with the tile system.</p>
<img src="../../images/portfolio/rav_stripes.jpg" alt="" align="middle">
<h6>6 lanes total, but you can only move inside the 4 inner lanes.</h6>

<p>The game generates two grids that move in a treadmill pattern. When a grid disappears at the top of the screen,
it reappears at the bottom of the current grid, and rearranges its tiles depending on the level design algorhythm,
and to the player the transition is seamless.</p>
<img src="../../images/portfolio/rav_grid.png" alt="" align="middle">
<h6>The red square is the area the player can see. Grid 2 moves up (1), and grid 1 moves out of the screen (2). Grid 2 now
occupies the whole screen (3), and grid 1 moves to the bottom (4).</h6>

<p>You have a limited length of rope you can rely on during every descent. When you run out of rope, you suddenly stop
and then you have to go back to the surface. You can find more rope on branches scattered on the ravine's walls, maybe lost
by previous adventurers who failed on their mission.</p>
<img src="../../images/portfolio/rav_rope.jpg" alt="" align="middle">
<h6>To the left: some rope stuck on a branch. To the right: a player running out of rope and returning to the surface.</h6>

<p>You start out with a hand drill you can use to gather different kinds of ore from the ravine's walls. To help with
one-handed usability, the character switches to the drill automatically when there are ore patches nearby, so the player
doesn't have to worry about an additional input when gathering resources. There is also a visual cue to let the player
know that an ore patch is coming: there are always unreachable bits of ore inside the walls, above the ore patch, that
appears before the collectable ore appears, so the player can have some more reaction time.</p>
<img src="../../images/portfolio/rav_ore.jpg" alt="" align="middle">
<h6>The player, about to gather some essencium, the basic ore.</h6>


<p>You can get 3 different ores. Essencium, the basic ore, resistum, the enduring ore, and brilhum, the shiny ore. Each
has its own use and crafting recipes.  You can craft machines and other things that can help you in your journey, like
a visor with a light that needs to be used in darker parts of the cave, and a machete that needs to be use in later stages
to destroy tentacles that sprout from the walls, and even combine ores to make different alloys.</p>

<h6>To the left, the crafting menu and the description of its items, and to the right some examples of resources and crafting recipes.</h6>

<p>By the end of the year the game was almost finished, albeit with a few bugs we couldn't fix. There was no time for polishing,
but we did fairly well at the final presentation. The professors really liked the idea for the research, which was <i>comfortable and safe one
handed usage of mobile devices.</i> The whole entire last year was dedicated to finding a problem related to game design, and I managed
to find one that was never really explored deeply, in the context of game development. Everyone on the group managed to pass the final year
and move on with their lives.<p>

<p>Here are some other development images and gifs.</p>

<h6>As the lead artist, I had tons of concept art to do. Luckly for me, I also had tons of spare time during
    the 5 daily hours I had on the train to go to and back from the campus. So I sketched a lot in my faithful sketchbook.</h6>

    <h6>The background of the surface went through a few iterations as the art style was being decided, until it finally
    got to the official one, inspired by black and white cartoons from the 1930s.</h6>

<h6>Also as the only animator, I had to advance with the animations of the main character, but his features weren't
defined yet, only the size of his body, so I made these as placeholder art to use while I decided how he would look.</h6>

<h6>The main character after his features were defined. It took a bit too much of my precious time because I needed
to do it frame by frame, like in the ol' days of animation, so it would fit the whole style of the game.</h6>

<h6>This project was also the first time that I worked with tilesets in unity. I was lucky enough to have some great help
from some programmers at the place I did an internship back then.</h6>

    <p><b>What you can do:</b> this version is feature complete. Please note that you may still encounter a few bugs,
    as there was time to finish the main mechanics but there wasn't much time to look for and squish bugs.</p>
