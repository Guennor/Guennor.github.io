  <h5>Ravina</h5>

  <p><b>My role in this project:</b> The project was almost entirely designed and implemented by me, except for a few things
      like the audio and save system.<p>
  <img src="../../images/portfolio/ravina_title.jpg" alt="" align="middle">
  <p><i><b>tl;dr:</b> A sort of "runner" game where you control an explorer diving into a ravine with a rope attached to
  himself. You can find more rope during your trips, to extend the maximum range you can reach on the following trips,
  and find resources to aid in your adventures.</i></p>


  <p>Ravina<b></b> is the game that I made for my final university assignment. Technically we had a year to make the game,
  but the first semester was almost entirely dedicated to the research and the second semester was dedicated to the game. The research was
about safe and comfortable one-handed usability for gaming in mobile devices, and the game was built to try to prove the
findings of the research. So yeah, we had a single semester to make it... seems like a lot of time, but not to my skills I guess!
The group had a disagreement on whether to start the game during our midterm break which divided the "research semester"
with the "game semester" so I had to go ahead and start production by myself, which is the reason the game was made almost
entirely by me - when the midterm break was over, the development was so advanced that they couldn't even understand my code enough
to be able to help implementing anything.
The part of the code with the save system was implemented by another team member, and the audio was acquired
and edited by another team member, but the rest of the game was made by me. The group helped with other very important tasks,
though, like polishing the GDD/research paper or creating the marketing document and doing other scholarly things I couldn't
focus on.</p>

<h2>The game</h2>

<img src="../../images/portfolio/rav_intro.gif" alt="" align="middle">

<p>You control an adventurous researcher that sets out to explore a mysterious ravine that opened up somewhere. Equipped with
some rope and mining equipment, you jump down to explore the narrow gorge. You can find lost pieces of rope from previous
adventurers, which allow you to reach further down on your following attempts.</p>
