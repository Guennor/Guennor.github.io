  <h5>Notable Mentions</h5>

  <p>I have some short-lived projects and ideas that are too small to have their own pages, so i'll just leave them here.<p>
      <br>
      
      <h2>Nom Forest</h2>
      <p>Nom Forest was supposed to be a computer game about food. You managed a small restaurant in the middle of a forest where travellers came and went. You could gather procedurally generated wild plants and plant them on your farm plots and you could domesticate all sorts of procedurally generated wild creatures and use their meat, milk and everything they provided to make food. Heavily inspired by dwarf fortress's food mechanics.<p>

    <h6>(Click to expand) I started researching about the processes and products involving food processing. It was fun to discover byproducts and their uses!</h6>

    <h6>After brainstorming a bit with my programmer buddy, we found the perfect name and I started sketching logos.</h6>

    <h6>The final-ish Logo</h6>

      <h6>As usual, a game design document is always useful to stay on track. I will not post the document here because I want to revisit the idea again when I have time in the future - but if you're a potential employer and wants too see it for employment reasons, just send me an e-mail!</h6>
      <br>
      <img src="../../images/portfolio/nf-03.jpg" alt="" align="middle" height="252" width="700">
      <h6>As we developed the game design document further, I started to think about the different size categories of animals.</h6>
      <br>
      <img src="../../images/portfolio/nf-06.gif" alt="" align="middle">
      <h6>Eventually I did a mockup for entities with modular parts that would be the basis of the procedural creature system in the future.</h6>
      
      <br>
      
            <p>It was a blast to come up with cooking mechanics and it was exciting to see some visual aspects of the game start coming to life. But sadly, my programmer buddy had to move to another project so I had to shelf Nom Forest, as it's a project that's too complicated for my programming skills.</p>
