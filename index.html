  <h5>Greetings, stranger!</h5>
  <p>Welcome to my website.</p>
  <p>So, here's a quick summary of my life, to replace the huge text that used to be here: I have been making games since
      I was a kid in tools like RPG Maker and The Games Factory. Started formally studying game development even before I
      finished highschool. Then went straight to college to get my bachelor's in game design. Have been making prototypes
      and game projects since then, and i'm looking for an oportunity overseas, to work with games someplace where my skills
      would be appreciated and where i'd be valued as a professional.</p>

    <h6>This simple website was made by me (with some help from my buddy Marcos!). I'd much rather have a simple website made by myself than a fancy one that I paid someone to make for me. Gotta have dat html/css knowledge!</h6>
